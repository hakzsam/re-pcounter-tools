Notes about the behaviours of NVPerfKit.

- It uses a round robin mode for handling multiple hw events using the SIMPLE mode
  on the same domain (tested with 4 hw events on domain 1).
- It also uses that mode for handling B4 + SIMPLE mode (tested with gpu_idle and
  geom_vertex_in_count).
- It uses a round robin mode for handling two hw events which share the same reg
  with a different value (mux).
